## About This Project

This repository contains detailed writeups for the **Natas** wargame from [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/), covering levels 0 through 34. Natas is a web security wargame that teaches the fundamentals of web application vulnerabilities through hands-on, practical challenges.

Each level is documented with a focus on understanding the underlying vulnerability, the exploitation process, and the defensive measures required to prevent it in real-world applications.

### Why Natas?

Natas is one of the best wargames for learning web security because:
- It starts with basic concepts and progressively increases in difficulty
- Each level introduces a new vulnerability or technique
- It requires minimal setup — only a browser and basic tools
- It covers both client-side and server-side vulnerabilities
- It's completely free and accessible online

### 🌍 Bilingual Support

This writeup is available in **two languages**:
- 🇬🇧 **English** — Full documentation of all levels
- 🇮🇷 **Persian (Farsi)** — Complete translation for Persian-speaking learners

## Key Security Lessons

Throughout this writeup series, the following security principles are emphasized:

### 1. Never Trust Client-Side Data
Everything sent to the browser — HTML comments, JavaScript, cookies — is fully inspectable and modifiable by the user.

### 2. Implement Server-Side Validation
Authentication, authorization, and input validation must always be performed on the server, never solely on the client.

### 3. Secure Configuration Is Critical
- Disable directory listing on web servers
- Don't use `robots.txt` to hide sensitive paths
- Store sensitive files outside the web root

### 4. Avoid Security by Obscurity
Hiding something does not make it secure. Attackers will find it.

### 5. Use Cryptographic Signing
Protect cookies and client-side state with cryptographic signatures to prevent tampering.

### 6. Use Prepared Statements
Parameterized queries are the most effective defense against SQL injection. No other defense is as reliable.

### 7. Disable External Entities in XML Parsers
XXE attacks can read local files and perform SSRF. Always disable external entity resolution.

### 8. Never Deserialize Untrusted Data
PHP object injection can lead to remote code execution. Use JSON instead of `serialize()`/`unserialize()`.

### 9. Validate File Uploads Thoroughly
Check file type, content, size, and store uploaded files outside the web root. Re-encode images to remove embedded code.

### 10. Use Strong Session Management
Session IDs must be cryptographically random with high entropy. Never use sequential or predictable IDs.

## درباره پروژه

این مخزن شامل راهنمای کامل بازی **ناتاس** از [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/natas/) است که سطوح ۰ تا ۳۴ را پوشش می‌دهد. ناتاس یک بازی جنگی در حوزه امنیت وب است که مفاهیم بنیادین آسیب‌پذیری‌های برنامه‌های وب را از طریق چالش‌های عملی و دستی آموزش می‌دهد.

هر سطح با تمرکز بر درک آسیب‌پذیری زیربنایی، فرآیند بهره‌برداری و اقدامات دفاعی مورد نیاز برای جلوگیری از آن در برنامه‌های واقعی مستند شده است.

### چرا ناتاس؟

ناتاس یکی از بهترین بازی‌های جنگی برای یادگیری امنیت وب است زیرا:
- با مفاهیم پایه شروع می‌شود و به تدریج دشواری آن افزایش می‌یابد
- هر سطح یک آسیب‌پذیری یا تکنیک جدید را معرفی می‌کند
- به حداقل تنظیمات نیاز دارد — فقط یک مرورگر و ابزارهای اولیه
- هر دو آسیب‌پذیری سمت کلاینت و سمت سرور را پوشش می‌دهد
- کاملاً رایگان و به صورت آنلاین در دسترس است

### 🌍 پشتیبانی دو زبانه

این راهنما به **دو زبان** در دسترس است:
- 🇬🇧 **انگلیسی** — مستندات کامل تمام سطوح
- 🇮🇷 **فارسی** — ترجمه کامل برای فارسی‌زبانان

## درس‌های کلیدی امنیتی

در طول این مجموعه راهنما، اصول امنیتی زیر مورد تأکید قرار می‌گیرند:

### ۱. هرگز به داده‌های سمت کلاینت اعتماد نکنید
هر چیزی که به مرورگر ارسال می‌شود — کامنت‌های HTML، جاوااسکریپت، کوکی‌ها — کاملاً قابل بازرسی و تغییر توسط کاربر است.

### ۲. اعتبارسنجی سمت سرور را پیاده‌سازی کنید
احراز هویت، مجوزدهی و اعتبارسنجی ورودی همیشه باید در سمت سرور انجام شود، نه تنها در سمت کلاینت.

### ۳. پیکربندی امن حیاتی است
- لیست دایرکتوری را در سرورهای وب غیرفعال کنید
- از `robots.txt` برای پنهان کردن مسیرهای حساس استفاده نکنید
- فایل‌های حساس را خارج از ریشه وب ذخیره کنید

### ۴. از امنیت از طریق پنهان‌کاری اجتناب کنید
پنهان کردن چیزی به معنای امن بودن آن نیست. مهاجمان آن را پیدا خواهند کرد.

### ۵. از امضای رمزنگاری استفاده کنید
از کوکی‌ها و وضعیت سمت کلاینت با امضای رمزنگاری برای جلوگیری از دستکاری محافظت کنید.

### ۶. از Prepared Statements استفاده کنید
پرس‌وجوهای پارامتری مؤثرترین دفاع در برابر تزریق SQL هستند. هیچ دفاع دیگری به این اندازه قابل اعتماد نیست.

### ۷. موجودیت‌های خارجی را در پردازشگرهای XML غیرفعال کنید
حملات XXE می‌توانند فایل‌های محلی را بخوانند و SSRF انجام دهند. همیشه تفکیک موجودیت خارجی را غیرفعال کنید.

### ۸. هرگز داده‌های غیرقابل اعتماد را Deserialize نکنید
تزریق آبجکت PHP می‌تواند به اجرای کد از راه دور منجر شود. به جای `serialize()`/`unserialize()` از JSON استفاده کنید.

### ۹. آپلود فایل‌ها را به طور کامل اعتبارسنجی کنید
نوع فایل، محتوا، اندازه را بررسی کنید و فایل‌های آپلود شده را خارج از ریشه وب ذخیره کنید. تصاویر را دوباره کدگذاری کنید تا کدهای جاسازی شده حذف شوند.

### ۱۰. از مدیریت نشست قوی استفاده کنید
شناسه‌های نشست باید به صورت رمزنگاری تصادفی با آنتروپی بالا باشند. هرگز از شناسه‌های ترتیبی یا قابل پیش‌بینی استفاده نکنید.
